Hi there!

Welcome to my re-create of Pong.

I originally began this project as a Spring Application using pure java in intellij

I wasn't really sure how to code shapes by pixel and such using java, so I thought I could make a mobile application. I really enjoyed using android studio so I went back to it. 

While working on this project I learned that you can store extra frame design details (like colour and shape) in a Paint object. You can then use a Canvas object to impliment those settings.

This project currently has an under developed log in page. This code was auto generated through Android Studio. Ultimately, connecting the application to live email addresses would be awesome.
	For small time purpose, however, I think creating a firebase DB with Pong-Specific user credentials and score storage would work perfectly.

While debugging this program my 'newthread' initializer asked me to create a bunch of override functions that I need to research because I don't understand. 

I also need to figure out why my GameState won't connect and initialize a new game state.

Currently the code in this project will show a game pad for the user to interact with, as these  'pad' commands are hard coded into android for users to use. 

I originally tried create a 'OnPress' method for the paddles, but soon realized I would have to break the already framed application into at least 4 frames (upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right) and code onpress functions for each of those to control the paddles.
In attempting this I got very confused and broke my project, so instead I looked up alternatives and found someone who had used this gamepad method.

I didn't know android had the gamepad function until this project!

Android applications are one of the few places I have a firm grasp on object oriented programming so I was thrilled to have the oppurtunity to revist.

I also used time at home to review code with friends at my local community college which I found very helpful. My friends and I had all taken java, none of them had seen python, and I'm really rusty on C# and C++ so over all it was a great learning oppurtunity.
